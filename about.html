    <h2>About</h2>
    
    <p>Hi! My name is Loryn, sometimes I go by Lo.</p>
    <p>I'm currently a freshman at the University of Houston studying Computer Science. My current career goal is to become a software engineer. I love being creative and solving problems. What better way is there to combine the two than creatively problem-solve as a software engineer?!</p>
    <p>Here's my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorynhigginbotham">LinkedIn!</a> A little bare, but still cool to see. :) </p>
